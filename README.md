# FMG-FONTS

A collection of open fonts to be used in [Fantasy Map Generator](https://github.com/Azgaar/Fantasy-Map-Generator).

## Usage

To use any of the fonts below you need to open FMG style settings, click on "+" to add new font and paste a link to @font-face declaration:

`https://azgaar.github.io/fmg-fonts/germanica.css`

Replace font name with desired one. Once enter is pressed, the font should be added to the FMG fonts list. If not, check the consile (F12) for errors.

## How it works

Linked .css files contain @font-face declaration, i.e. basically a font name and links to font files in different formats.

Available formats may be significantly limited, so some fonts may not work in some browsers.

See [Using @font-face](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/using-font-face/) by Chris Coyier for the details.

## Contributing

To add new fonts please open an issue or make PR. Please link the font and make sure it is available under open license (e.g. OFL).
